# Frame-Template
# Simple HTML/CSS Template Web-Page 

This is a basic web template built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It is inspired by uicookies.com which originally used **Bootstrap** for styling.

The purpose of this project is to create a lightweight version of the design without relying on any CSS frameworks(and also with some improvments!)
